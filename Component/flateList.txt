renderItem props acts as a map and returns one by one the array item in function.

in flate list key is chenged into string becouse flatelist only accepts the key as a string.

if an array does not have key then we can do this by keyExtractor=>

inside keyExtractor we define a function that retrns the item and index of the array
which can use its index as a key
